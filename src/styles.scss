// Import Bootstrap (modern @use syntax)
@use 'bootstrap/scss/bootstrap' as *;

// Import Bootstrap Icons (plain CSS)
@import 'bootstrap-icons/font/bootstrap-icons.css';

// NOTE: Component-specific styles (tabs, tables, animations, responsive tweaks)
// have been moved into their respective component SCSS files to avoid
// leaking styles globally. Keep only global imports here.
